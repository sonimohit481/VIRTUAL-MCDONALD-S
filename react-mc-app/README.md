## ⚙️ Tech Stack

This project uses a powerful set of technologies for building modern web applications:

### Front-End

- **React** ![React](https://img.icons8.com/color/48/000000/react.png)  
  A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Used here to create interactive components and manage the UI efficiently.

- **Vite** ![Vite](https://img.icons8.com/ios/50/000000/vite.png)  
  A modern build tool that focuses on speed and optimization. It ensures fast hot-reloading and quick production builds.

- **Tailwind CSS** ![Tailwind CSS](https://img.icons8.com/ios/50/000000/tailwind-css.png)  
  A utility-first CSS framework that allows you to build custom designs quickly by composing utility classes.

- **Formik** & **Yup** ![Formik](https://img.icons8.com/ios/50/000000/formik.png)  
  Formik handles form state management, and Yup is used for form validation, making it easy to build robust forms with minimal effort.

- **React Router** ![React Router](https://img.icons8.com/ios/50/000000/react-router.png)  
  A library for handling navigation and routing in React applications.

- **React-Redux** ![Redux](https://img.icons8.com/ios/50/000000/redux.png)  
  State management tool for handling complex states in large applications, ensuring data is shared and synchronized across components.

### Back-End

- **Appwrite** ![Appwrite](https://img.icons8.com/ios/50/000000/appwrite.png)  
  Appwrite is used for authentication, user management, and order storage. It provides simple-to-use APIs for managing users and data in a secure and scalable way.

- **Razorpay** ![Razorpay](https://img.icons8.com/ios/50/000000/razorpay.png)  
  Razorpay is integrated for payment processing, handling secure online payments and order transactions.

### Libraries & Tools

- **Axios** ![Axios](https://img.icons8.com/ios/50/000000/axios.png)  
  Used to make HTTP requests to external APIs (such as Appwrite and Razorpay) to fetch or send data.

- **Canvas Confetti** ![Canvas Confetti](https://img.icons8.com/ios/50/000000/confetti.png)  
  Used to add celebratory animations, like confetti, on successful transactions or actions.

### Development Tools

- **Vite**: Fast build tool with live-reload and optimized production build.
- **ESLint**: Code quality and linting tool to ensure consistency and prevent errors in code.

## 🔌 Web APIs Used

### 1. **Appwrite API**

Appwrite is the backend server used for managing user authentication and storing orders. It provides simple REST APIs to:

- **Authenticate Users**: Sign up, log in, and manage user sessions.
- **Store Orders**: Save order data, retrieve and manage them.

### 2. **Razorpay API**

Razorpay is used to handle payments within the app. The API allows:

- **Create Payment Orders**: Generate payment requests.
- **Payment Confirmation**: Securely process payments and receive success/failure responses.

## ⚡ Features

- **User Authentication**: Sign-up and log-in functionalities powered by Appwrite.
- **Order Management**: Users can create and manage orders, which are stored securely via Appwrite.
- **Payment Integration**: Razorpay handles online payments, making transactions smooth and secure.
- **Responsive UI**: Designed using Tailwind CSS, the app adapts to different screen sizes seamlessly.

## ✨ Future Enhancements

- **Multi-Currency Support**: Integrate additional payment gateways and currency options.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Incorporate Firebase analytics for deeper insights into user behavior and app performance.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React** for building interactive UIs
- **Vite** for fast builds
- **Tailwind CSS** for fast and responsive styling
- **Appwrite** for user authentication and order management
- **Razorpay** for secure payment processing
